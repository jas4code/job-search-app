# Welcome to my Job Search App! ðŸ‘‹

I made this app to learn about **React-Native JS**, a way to build mobile apps, and how to use its basic parts. I also wanted to understand how to move between different parts of the app, which is called _routing_. For that, I used a tool called **expo-router**.

Another thing I wanted to learn was how to get information from other places on the internet. I used a tool called **Axios** to do that. With Axios, I connected to a place called **Rapid API**, which has lots of job listings. This helped me make the app show real job listings from around the web.

Lastly, this app is my final project for my Mobile Technology class. It's the result of all the things I've learned about making apps for phones. I hope you like using it as much as I enjoyed making it!
